# docker-k6-grafana-influxdb

Demonstrates how to run load tests with containerised instances of K6, Grafana, Jenkins and InfluxDB.

#### Dashboards

The dashboard in /dashboards is adapted from the excellent K6 / Grafana dashboard here:
https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/2587

There are only two small modifications:

- the data source is configured to use the docker created InfluxDB data source
- the time period is set to now-15m, which I feel is a better view for most tests

#### Scripts

The script here is an example of a low Virtual User (VU) load test of the excellent Star Wars API:

If you're tinkering with the script, it is just a friendly open source API, be gentle!
